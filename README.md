### To do (frontend)

1. Connect the app to API. Currently it displays hardcoded set of products.

2. Client-side request to API make the app score bad in context of SEO. Can we change it?

3. Some components re-render unnecessarily and there's some logic ran unnecessarily on every render. Optimize the app.

4. Mobile mode styles are broken, please fix this before we release! :(

5. *(OPTIONAL)* Can we always display selected product at the beginning of the list regardless of selected tag? So user always knows which product he or she has already choosen while he or she continues browsing.
